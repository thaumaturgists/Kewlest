# A easy to understand and detailed explanation of the "src:"
```js
const MusicMixer: React.FC = () => {
    const musicList: Music[] = [
        {
            src: "https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1234567890y=true&show_artwork=false&show_comments=false&hide_related=true&show_user=true&buying=false&liking=false&show_playcount=false&sharing=false&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=false&download=false",
            title: "Your Playlist Title 1"
        },
        {
            src: "YOUR_MUSIC_LINK_2", // Replace with your own SoundCloud playlist link
            title: "Your Playlist Title 2" // Replace with your own title
        },
        {
            src: "YOUR_MUSIC_LINK_3", // Replace with your own SoundCloud playlist link
            title: "Your Playlist Title 3" // Replace with your own title
        }
    ];
```

1. **src**: This is the source URL for the SoundCloud player. It contains several parameters that dictate how the player behaves and what it displays. Here's a breakdown of the URL:

   - **Base URL**: `https://w.soundcloud.com/player/` - This is the main URL for the SoundCloud player.
   - **url**: This parameter specifies the content to be played. In this case, it points to a specific playlist on SoundCloud, identified by the ID `1234567890`.
   - **auto_play=true**: This means the music will start playing automatically when the player loads.
   - **show_artwork=false**: This hides the artwork associated with the playlist.
   - **show_comments=false**: This disables the comments section in the player.
   - **hide_related=true**: This prevents related tracks from being shown.
   - **show_user=true**: This displays the user who created the playlist.
   - **buying=false**: This disables any buying options for the tracks.
   - **liking=false**: This disables the option to like the tracks.
   - **show_playcount=false**: This hides the play count for the tracks.
   - **sharing=false**: This disables sharing options for the tracks.
   - **show_reposts=false**: This hides any reposts of the tracks.
   - **show_teaser=true**: This allows a teaser of the tracks to be shown.
   - **visual=false**: This disables any visualizations that might accompany the music.
   - **download=false**: This disables the download option for the tracks.

2. **title**: This is a simple label for the embedded player. In this case, it is titled "Trending Music - Indie," indicating that the playlist features popular indie music tracks.

### Summary
In summary, this code snippet is used to embed a SoundCloud player on a website that plays a specific playlist of trending indie music. The player is configured to auto-play the music without showing artwork, comments, or related tracks, while still displaying the user who created the playlist. The options for buying, liking, sharing, and downloading are all disabled, and a teaser of the tracks is allowed.

# Guide for retrieving a iframe from SoundCloud

Here’s the updated guide for retrieving an iframe from SoundCloud, incorporating your instructions:

1. **Find the Track or Playlist**: Go to the SoundCloud website and locate the track or playlist you want to embed.

2. **Access the Embed Option**:
   - On the home feed or anywhere you see the three dots (...) icon, click on it.
   - Select "Share" from the dropdown menu.
   - In the Share pop-up, click on the "Embed" tab.

3. **Customize Your Iframe**: In the embed section, you may have options to customize your iframe, such as changing the color or size of the player.

4. **Copy the Iframe Code**: Once you have customized the player to your liking, copy the iframe code provided.

5. **Embed in Your Website**: Paste the copied iframe code into the HTML of your website where you want the SoundCloud player to appear.

6. **Adjust as Necessary**: You can adjust the width and height attributes in the iframe code to fit your design needs.

### Example Iframe Code
Here’s an example of what the iframe code might look like:

```html
<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1234567890&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=true&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>
<div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;">
    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/trending-music-us" title="Trending Music" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Trending Music</a> · 
    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/trending-music-us/sets/indie-1" title="Indie" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Indie</a>
</div>
```

Replace the URL in the `src` attribute with the actual URL of the track or playlist you want to embed. 

That's it! You should now have a SoundCloud iframe embedded in your website.

#  Let's break down the components of the iframe code and the accompanying div element in the example provided:

### Iframe Breakdown

```html
<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1234567890&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>
```

1. **`<iframe>`**: This tag is used to embed another document within the current HTML document. In this case, it embeds the SoundCloud player.

2. **`width="100%"`**: This attribute sets the width of the iframe to 100% of its parent container, making it responsive to the width of the screen or the element it is contained within.

3. **`height="450"`**: This attribute sets the height of the iframe to 450 pixels. You can adjust this value to make the player taller or shorter.

4. **`scrolling="no"`**: This attribute disables scrolling within the iframe. If the content exceeds the iframe's height, no scrollbars will appear.

5. **`frameborder="no"`**: This attribute removes the border around the iframe. Note that this attribute is deprecated in HTML5, and CSS should be used for styling instead.

6. **`allow="autoplay"`**: This attribute allows the embedded content to autoplay audio. Without this, the audio may not play automatically due to browser restrictions.

7. **`src="..."`**: This attribute specifies the URL of the content to be embedded. In this case, it points to the SoundCloud player with various parameters:
   - **`url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1734880641`**: This is the URL of the specific playlist you want to embed. The URL is URL-encoded (e.g., `:` becomes `%3A`).
   - **`color=%23ff5500`**: This sets the color of the player. The color is specified in hexadecimal format (in this case, a shade of orange).
   - **`auto_play=false`**: This parameter indicates that the audio should not autoplay when the page loads.
   - **`hide_related=false`**: This parameter controls whether related tracks are shown. Setting it to `false` means related tracks will be displayed.
   - **`show_comments=true`**: This parameter indicates that comments on the track should be displayed.
   - **`show_user=true`**: This parameter indicates that the user who uploaded the track should be displayed.
   - **`show_reposts=false`**: This parameter controls whether reposts are shown. Setting it to `false` means reposts will not be displayed.
   - **`show_teaser=true`**: This parameter indicates that a teaser for the track should be shown.

### Div Element Breakdown

```html
<div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc; line-break: anywhere; word-break: normal; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate, Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Sans, Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-weight: 100;">
    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/trending-music-us" title="Trending Music" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Trending Music</a> · 
    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/trending-music-us/sets/indie-1" title="Indie" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Indie</a>
</div>
```

1. **`<div>`**: This tag is a container for the text and links that provide additional information about the embedded content.

2. **`style="..."`**: This attribute contains inline CSS styles that control the appearance of the text within the div:
   - **`font-size: 10px;`**: Sets the font size to 10 pixels.
   - **`color: #cccccc;`**: Sets the text color to a light gray.
   - **`line-break: anywhere;`**: Allows line breaks to occur at any character.
   - **`word-break: normal;`**: Sets the word breaking behavior to normal.
   - **`overflow: hidden;`**: Hides any content that overflows the bounds of the div.
   - **`white-space: nowrap;`**: Prevents the text from wrapping to the next line.
   
   - **`text-overflow: ellipsis;`**: This property is used to indicate that if the text overflows the container, it should be truncated and an ellipsis (`...`) should be displayed at the end. This is useful for keeping the layout tidy when the text is too long to fit in the available space.

   - **`font-family: Interstate, Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Sans, Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;`**: This property specifies the font family for the text. It lists several fonts in order of preference. If the first font (`Interstate`) is not available, the browser will try the next one (`Lucida Grande`), and so on. The last option, `sans-serif`, is a generic fallback that will use any available sans-serif font.

   - **`font-weight: 100;`**: This property sets the weight (thickness) of the font. A value of `100` indicates a very light font weight, making the text appear thinner.

### Links Inside the Div

Within the `<div>`, there are two `<a>` (anchor) elements:

1. **First Link**:
   ```html
   <a href="https://soundcloud.com/trending-music-us" title="Trending Music" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Trending Music</a>
   ```
   - **`href="https://soundcloud.com/trending-music-us"`**: This attribute specifies the URL that the link points to. When clicked, it will take the user to the "Trending Music" page on SoundCloud.
   - **`title="Trending Music"`**: This attribute provides additional information about the link, which is displayed as a tooltip when the user hovers over it.
   - **`target="_blank"`**: This attribute makes the link open in a new tab or window when clicked, allowing users to keep the original page open.
   - **`style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;"`**: This inline style sets the text color to light gray and removes the default underline from the link.

2. **Second Link**:
   ```html
   <a href="https://soundcloud.com/trending-music-us/sets/indie-1" title="Indie" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Indie</a>
   ```
   - Similar to the first link, this anchor element points to a specific playlist titled "Indie."
   - The attributes and styles are the same as those in the first link, ensuring consistency in appearance.

### Summary

In summary, the iframe code embeds a SoundCloud player for a specific playlist, allowing users to listen to the music directly on your website. The accompanying div provides context and links to related content, styled to fit seamlessly with the player. The combination of these elements creates an interactive and visually appealing way to share music from SoundCloud.
